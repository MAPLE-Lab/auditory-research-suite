#summary Available Properties for <experiment>.properties files.
<wiki:toc max_depth="2"/>
------
Properties files match a key to a value to allow per experiment configuration of parameters.

They follow the form: 
{{{key= value}}}

To break up long values, escape to the next line by putting a backslash (\) at the end of a line.
Example:
<pre>
    key= this is a very long\
    string value that had to be split
</pre>

Different experiments try to read the values for different keys. Extraneous key value pairs are ignored.

= General Properties =
== Experiment logging ==
|| _*Property*_ || _*Possible Values*_ || _*Usage Notes*_ ||
|| *experimentID* || integer || Use for storing/labeling data about a specific experiment number ||
|| *subExperimentID* || integer || Use for storing/labeling data about a specific experiment number ||
|| *debug* || boolean || Turn on to show debug console window ||

== Trial Blocks Setup ==
|| _*Property*_ || _*Possible Values*_ || _*Usage Notes*_ ||
|| *blockSetRepetitions* || positive integer || Number of times blocks should be presented. Blocks sets are sets of [no. of offsetDegrees] trials. A set of blocks covers every baseIOI with and without tapping, so the number of blocks in a full set is [no. baseIOIs]`*`2. Each set of blocks will be randomized independently, unless specified. ||
|| *metablocks* || non-negative integer|| Metablocks are groups of blocks, possibly repeated ||
|| *randomizeBlocks* || boolean || Randomizes the order of blocks within different metablocks ||
|| *randomizeTrials* || boolean || Randomizes the order of trials within different blocks ||

------
= Rhythm Specific Properties =

|| _*Property*_ || _*Possible Values*_ || _*Usage Notes*_ ||
|| *speedMode* || boolean || Debug setting. Flag to divide IOIs by 10 for testing experiment quickly. ||
|| *randomizeAcrossRepetitions* || boolean || true indicates that all trials within a block will be randomized, even across repetitions. Specialization for rhythm, see [PropertiesFiles#Trial_Blocks_Setup general block setup] ||
|| *middleC* || Pitch value || Set the Middle-C value to make instrument specification easier with different SoundBanks, as each use a different representation. Value is normally labeled either "C3", "C4", or "C5". This defaults to C4. Octave values from 5 below to 5 above are allowed around this Middle C, as per MIDI specification. For example, if set to C4, this allows notes in octaves from -1 to 9. ||
|| *usePercussionChannel* || boolean || If this is set to true, rhythm will be generated using the Percussion channel instruments.  The soundbank being used will need to have percussion instruments, which will be mapped by Notes/(Pitches) instead of instrument numbers. ||
|| *instrumentNumber* || int [0,127] || General midi bank number to select for playback instrument. [0..127]. If usePercussionChannel is false, this sets the instrument to use. Otherwise (when usePercussionChannel is true) this sets the drum-kit to use, which is normally a value in the set [0,8,16,24,32,40,48,56], but can vary based on the Soundbank being used. ||

== Trial Specification ==
|| _*Property*_ || _*Possible Values*_ || _*Usage Notes*_ ||
|| *trialSpecificationStyle* || _HighLowPitches, PatternWithNotes_ || Specify which style of pattern input to use for building trial note sequences. Defaults to PatternWithNotes ||
|| *baseIOIs* || comma delimited list of integers || List of integers specifying the inter-onset time between notes in milliseconds. This is basically a psychologists way of discussing tempo. An IOI of 1000 means that notes are spaced 1 second apart, and would correspond to a musical tempo marking of 60 beats per minute. ||
|| *offsetDegrees* || comma delimited list of floats || List representing fraction of baseIOI that probe tone should be offset [0-1] So for example, a 0.1 for BaseIOI=600 means trials at 600+/-60 (540 and 660). ||
|| *probeDetuneAmounts* || comma delimited list of integers || List of probe detune offsets, which pitchbend the probe by cents (hundredths of semitones). Can take any values, allowing arbitrary detuning to the extremes allowed by MIDI. Leaving empty or setting to just '0' will effectively cause the experiment to run as before the inclusion of probe detunes.  ||

WARNING: offsetDegrees and probeDetuneAmounts should not both have multiple values. This would create experiments where both variables were varied, while we can only test one type of varying parameter. See more important notes at [PropertiesFiles#Question_Labeling Question Labeling].

==== For HighLowPitches specification ====
|| *highPitch* || Pitch value || Note value played on the stressed beat. ||
|| *lowPitch* || Pitch value || Note value played on non-stressed beats. ||
|| *playbackMeasures* || non-negative integer || Number of measures played ||
|| *beatsPerMeasure* || non-negative integer || Number of beats per measures (first beat is the stressed one) ||
|| *silenceMultiplier* || non-negative integer || Number of IOI units of silence after sounded measures (not including offset) ||

==== For PatternWithNotes specification ====
*Pitch* is given as a Note value

*Velocity* is an integer in [0,127] (defaults to 64)

*Duration* is a percentage of the baseIOI that the note should play. Float value (defaults to 1.0). This allows for arbitrary timings by changing the [PropertiesFiles#Trial_Specification baseIOI].

|| *trialNotePattern* || String Pattern consisting of [pst`_*`] || Specified with the characters 'p' (primary), 's' (secondary), 't' (tertiary), '`_`' (silence), '`*`' (probe). Capitalization and spaces are ignored for readability. Example: `Psts Psts Psts P_ _ _ *` ||
|| *primaryPitch* || Pitch value || ||
|| *primaryVelocity* || int [0,127] || ||
|| *primaryDuration* || float || ||
|| *secondaryPitch* || Pitch value || ||
|| *secondaryVelocity* || int [0,127] || ||
|| *secondaryDuration* || float || ||
|| *tertiaryPitch* || Pitch value || ||
|| *tertiaryVelocity* || int [0,127] || ||
|| *tertiaryDuration* || float || ||
|| *probePitch* || Pitch value || If unspecified, will default to the same as the primary pitch. ||
|| *probeVelocity* || int [0,127] || ||
|| *probeDuration* || float || ||
|| *silenceDuration* || float || ||

== Question Labeling ==
|| _*Property*_ || _*Possible Values*_ || _*Usage Notes*_ ||
|| *experimentTestingType* || _OffsetTiming, ProbeDetune_ || Indicates what type of testing this experiment will run. If value is "_OffsetTiming_", will check subject responses against offset timing. (Make sure to only have zero or one probeDetuneAmounts value when testing timing.) If value is "_ProbeDetune_", will check subject responses against probe detune. (Make sure to only have zero or one offsetDegrees value when testing detune.) No current support for recording both types simultaneously. ||
|| *question.label* || string || This labels the question part of user response. Change based on experiment, e.g. "Accurate timing?" or "Accurate tuning?" ||
|| *answerPositive.label* || string || Suggested value: "Yes" ||
|| *answerNegative.label* || string || Suggested value: "No" ||
|| *answerPositive.hotkey* || string || Suggested value: 'y' ||
|| *answerNegative.hotkey* || string || Suggested value: 'n' ||

Hotkeys must all be unique, or erroneous behavior will occur. Only first character from string will be used for hotkey.

== Confidence Labeling == 

Property keys for confidence must be of the form: "confidence.{integer}" where the integer is >= confidenceMin Values may not be skipped, although order does not matter.

Example:
<pre> 
confidenceMin=-2
confidenceOrderHighToLow=true
confidence.-2=Very unconfident
confidence.-1=Somewhat unconfident
confidence.1=Somewhat confident
confidence.0=Unsure
confidence.2=Very confident
confidence.-2.hotkey=	1
confidence.-1.hotkey=	2
confidence.0.hotkey=	3
confidence.1.hotkey=	4
confidence.2.hotkey=	5
</pre>

|| _*Property*_ || _*Possible Values*_ || _*Usage Notes*_ ||
|| *confidenceMin* || integer || The minimum (numerically) confidence value ||
|| *confidenceOrderHighToLow* || boolean || Indicates the numeric order (descending) in which the confidence levels will appear: true indicates high-to-low, false indicates low-to-high. ||
|| *confidence.{integer}* || string || label for confidence level {integer} ||
|| *confidence.{integer}.hotkey* || string || hotkey for confidence level {integer} ||

== User Tap Responses ==
|| _*Property*_ || _*Possible Values*_ || _*Usage Notes*_ ||
|| *withTapText* || 
|| *withoutTapText* ||
|| *enterResponseText* ||
|| *computerKeyInput* ||
|| *recordNoteOff* ||
|| *recordActualTapNote* ||
|| *recordActualTapVelocity* ||
|| *suppressionWindow* ||
|| *subjectTapSound* ||
|| *subjectTapVelocity* ||
|| *subjectTapNote* ||
|| *subjectTapGain* ||
|| *subjectNoTapGain* ||
|| *subjectTapInstrumentNumber* ||
