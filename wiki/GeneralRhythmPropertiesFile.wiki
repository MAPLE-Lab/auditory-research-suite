# Number of times blocks should be presented.
# Blocks sets are sets of [no. of offsetDegrees] trials.

# so the number of blocks in a full set is [no. baseIOIs]*2
# Each set of blocks will be randomized independently, unless specified
# otherwise

# Set the Middle-C value to make instrument specification easier with
# different SoundBanks, as each use a different representation. 
# Value is normally labeled either "C3", "C4", or "C5". This defaults to C4.

# For example, if set to C4, this allows notes in octaves from -1 to 9.

# List of integers specifying the inter-onset time between notes in milliseconds. 
# This is basically a psychologists way of discussing tempo.

# correspond to a musical tempo marking of 60 beats per minute.
baseIOIs=400,600

offsetDegrees=0

# List of probe detune offsets, which pitchbend the probe by cents (hundredths of semitones).
# Can take any values, allowing arbitrary detuning to the extremes allowed by MIDI.
# Leaving empty or setting to just '0' will effectively cause the experiment to run as before the
# inclusion of probe detunes.

# Indicates what type of testing this experiment will run.
# If value is "OffsetTiming", will check subject responses against offset timing.

<html><p>Welcome! In this experiment, you will hear a regularly occurring pattern of beats with which you will be instructed to \
either tap along, or listen without tapping. The beats will occur in a repeating sequence ; 1-2-3-4  1-2-3-4 . . .  , where the 1st \
beat is accented (emphasized). This sequence will repeat 4 times, but on the last 1-2-3-4 pattern, the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th beat are \
silent. One final accented beat will occur afterwards. Your job is to identify if the final beat occurs on time, or whether it is not on \
time.</p> \
