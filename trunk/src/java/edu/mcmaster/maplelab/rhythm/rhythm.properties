# ***** Experiment Details *****

# Number of times a full set of blocks should be presented.
# Blocks sets are sets of [no. of offsetDegrees] trials.
# A set of blocks covers every baseIOI with and without tapping,
# so the number of blocks in a full set is [no. baseIOIs]*2
# Each set of blocks will be randomized independently.

# List of integers specifying the inter-onset time between notes in milliseconds. 
# This is basically a psychologists way of discussing tempo. 
# An IOI of 1000 means that notes are spaced 1 second apart, and would 
# correspond to a musical tempo marking of 60 beats per minute.
baseIOIs=400,600
# List representing fraction of baseIOI that probe tone should be offset [0-1]
# So for example, a 0.1 for BaseIOI=600 means trials at 600+/-60 (540 and 660).

<html><p>Welcome! In this experiment, you will hear a regularly occurring pattern of beats with which you will be instructed to either tap along, or listen without tapping. The beats will occur in a repeating sequence ; 1-2-3-4  1-2-3-4 . . .  , where the 1st beat is accented (emphasized). This sequence will repeat 4 times, but on the last 1-2-3-4 pattern, the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th beat are silent. One final accented beat will occur afterwards. Your job is to identify if the final beat occurs on time, or whether it is not on time.</p> \
